# Subjective Text Complexity Corpus for German

A corpus consisting of German sentences, annotated with subjective complexity ratings by two target groups.

322 sentences annotated with complexity ratings of (1) experts and (2) non-experts on a 5-point-Likert scale (1-very easy to 5-very complex).

Data comes from DATEV, a German IT service provider in the context of German tax consultants, auditors, and lawyers. The sentences have been extracted from 232 documents regarding instructions, commentaries and descriptions which address employees of the service provider, as well as external users of the system. They often describe technical solutions to the company's products or give more detailed descriptions about law regulations affecting the company's clients.
